# The Eaglercraft Archive Channel

An archive of many Eaglercraft versions for download and forking.

**This isn't always up to date.**

Be sure to check somewhere else if the last commit was over a month ago. I only remember to update this if I get a notification about it.



I highly recommend forking this. It's very likely to be taken down at some point due to all the downloads and since this is Github.
